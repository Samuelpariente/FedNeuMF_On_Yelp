# Comparative Analysis of NeuMF and FedNeuMF Recommender Systems Project

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of Neural Matrix Factorization (NeuMF) and Federated Neural Matrix Factorization (FedNeuMF) applied to the Yelp Open Dataset. It focuses on performance metrics, operational cost, and carbon emissions, aiming to illuminate trade-offs between centralized and federated approaches in recommender systems.

## Introduction/Motivation
Motivated by the importance of recommender systems in online services, this project explores the balance between performance, privacy, cost, and ecological considerations in recommender systems. It compares the conventional centralized approach, NeuMF, with the privacy-preserving, distributed approach, FedNeuMF.

## Problem Definition
The research compares NeuMF and FedNeuMF on the Yelp dataset across several dimensions: performance metrics (MAP, Recall, Precision, NDCG), operational costs, and carbon emissions.

## Related Work
Discusses matrix factorization, neural collaborative filtering, privacy-preserving recommenders, and carbon emission studies in federated learning.

## Methodology
Details the dataset used, implementation of NeuMF and FedNeuMF models, cost analysis, and the approach to estimate carbon impact.

## Evaluation
Assesses performance metrics, conducts cost analysis, and estimates the carbon impact using the Yelp dataset, comparing FedNeuMF's effectiveness with NeuMF.

## Conclusions
Summarizes findings and provides recommendations for future implementations, emphasizing the need to balance model performance, operational cost, and environmental considerations.
